/// this is a polymorphic resource manager.
/// the resource can be a part of the manager
/// (intrusive/self-managed) or even be externally located (non-intrusive, or
/// separate control block). management of the resource can be intrusive or
/// non-intrusive which makes it flexible.
///
/// the manager is free to delete itself once the resource ref count reaches
/// 0. the manager can also delegate the destruction of itself
/// and its associated resource. i.e. delegating resource management to a memory
/// pool segment or bulk-allocated memory segment.
///
/// the resource management is decoupled from the resource or control block.
///
/// this enables a couple of use-cases:
///
/// - use in embedded systems (via static storage and static memory pools)
/// - use in single-threaded environments where ref-counting might not be
/// needed.
/// - use in scenarios where the user is certain the resource will always
/// outlive the Rc
/// - usage with custom memory management solutions (i.e. pool/bulk-based
/// solutions)
///
/// this is a scalable abstraction over resource management, ***I think***.
///
/// coincidentally, this should be able to support  reference counting
/// by swapping out the `ManagerType` arguments of the Rc, how that'd be useful,
/// I'm still figuring out.

/// resource handles can be of any type. not just pointers which is only what
/// `shared_ptr` supports.
